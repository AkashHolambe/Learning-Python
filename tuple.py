# Tuples are immutable data types eaning once they are created,
# their elements cannot be changed. Here are some key characteristics and operations of tuples in Python:

# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)

# Creating a tuple without parentheses (comma-separated values)
another_tuple = 4, 5, 6
print(another_tuple)  # Output: (4, 5, 6)

# Creating a tuple with a single element (comma is needed)
single_element_tuple = (7,)
print(single_element_tuple)  # Output: (7,)

# Empty tuple
empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple)  # Output: ()
